### Count Down Study Timer

A count down application that allows multiple timers to play at once. One is able to update the text manually and add a manual amount of hours and minutes. You are able to add and remove the study timers as desired and title as desired. In settings there is an option for setting a default time and default title for a new entry. 

Known issues: 
- removing views through finishing the count down timer _sometimes_ crashes
- timers running when app is not open
- handling of format validation for use in timers not fully implemented
